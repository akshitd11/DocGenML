If the airflow scheduler restarts with pending "Queued" tasks, the tasks may or
        may not
        have been launched Thus, on starting up the scheduler let's check every
        "Queued" task to
        see if it has been launched (ie: if there is a corresponding pod on kubernetes)

        If it has been launched then do nothing, otherwise reset the state to "None" so
        the task
        will be rescheduled

        This will not be necessary in a future version of airflow in which there is
        proper support
        for State.LAUNCHED
