Like a Python builtin dict object, setdefault returns the current value
        for a key, and if it isn't there, stores the default value and returns it.

        :param key: Dict key for this Variable
        :type key: str
        :param default: Default value to set and return if the variable
            isn't already in the DB
        :type default: Mixed
        :param deserialize_json: Store this as a JSON encoded value in the DB
            and un-encode it when retrieving a value
        :return: Mixed
