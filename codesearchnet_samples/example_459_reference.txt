Determines whether a task is ready to be rescheduled. Only tasks in
        NONE state with at least one row in task_reschedule table are
        handled by this dependency class, otherwise this dependency is
        considered as passed. This dependency fails if the latest reschedule
        request's reschedule date is still in future.
