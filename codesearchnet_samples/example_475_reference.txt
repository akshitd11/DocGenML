Transfers a local file to the remote location.

        If local_full_path_or_buffer is a string path, the file will be read
        from that location; if it is a file-like buffer, the file will
        be read from the buffer but not closed.

        :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file
        :type remote_full_path: str
        :param local_full_path_or_buffer: full path to the local file or a
            file-like buffer
        :type local_full_path_or_buffer: str or file-like buffer
