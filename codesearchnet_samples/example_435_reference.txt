Get all instances of the `object` from Salesforce.
        For each model, only get the fields specified in fields.

        All we really do underneath the hood is run:
            SELECT <fields> FROM <obj>;

        :param obj: The object name to get from Salesforce.
        :type obj: str
        :param fields: The fields to get from the object.
        :type fields: iterable
        :return: all instances of the object from Salesforce.
        :rtype: dict
