Kubernetes only supports lowercase alphanumeric characters and "-" and "." in
        the pod name
        However, there are special rules about how "-" and "." can be used so let's
        only keep
        alphanumeric chars  see here for detail:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/

        :param string: The requested Pod name
        :return: ``str`` Pod name stripped of any unsafe characters
