Upload a file to Azure Data Lake.

        :param local_path: local path. Can be single file, directory (in which case,
            upload recursively) or glob pattern. Recursive glob patterns using `**`
            are not supported.
        :type local_path: str
        :param remote_path: Remote path to upload to; if multiple files, this is the
            directory root to write within.
        :type remote_path: str
        :param nthreads: Number of threads to use. If None, uses the number of cores.
        :type nthreads: int
        :param overwrite: Whether to forcibly overwrite existing files/directories.
            If False and remote path is a directory, will quit regardless if any files
            would be overwritten or not. If True, only matching filenames are actually
            overwritten.
        :type overwrite: bool
        :param buffersize: int [2**22]
            Number of bytes for internal buffer. This block cannot be bigger than
            a chunk and cannot be smaller than a block.
        :type buffersize: int
        :param blocksize: int [2**22]
            Number of bytes for a block. Within each chunk, we write a smaller
            block for each API call. This block cannot be bigger than a chunk.
        :type blocksize: int
