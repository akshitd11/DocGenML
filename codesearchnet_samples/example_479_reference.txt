Set the state of a task instance and if needed its relatives. Can set state
    for future tasks (calculated from execution_date) and retroactively
    for past tasks. Will verify integrity of past dag runs in order to create
    tasks that did not exist. It will not create dag runs that are missing
    on the schedule (but it will as for subdag dag runs if needed).
    :param task: the task from which to work. task.task.dag needs to be set
    :param execution_date: the execution date from which to start looking
    :param upstream: Mark all parents (upstream tasks)
    :param downstream: Mark all siblings (downstream tasks) of task_id, including SubDags
    :param future: Mark all future tasks on the interval of the dag up until
        last execution date.
    :param past: Retroactively mark all tasks starting from start_date of the DAG
    :param state: State to which the tasks need to be set
    :param commit: Commit tasks to be altered to the database
    :param session: database session
    :return: list of tasks that have been created and updated
