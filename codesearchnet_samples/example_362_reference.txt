Pull XComs that optionally meet certain criteria.

        The default value for `key` limits the search to XComs
        that were returned by other tasks (as opposed to those that were pushed
        manually). To remove this filter, pass key=None (or any desired value).

        If a single task_id string is provided, the result is the value of the
        most recent matching XCom from that task_id. If multiple task_ids are
        provided, a tuple of matching values is returned. None is returned
        whenever no matches are found.

        :param key: A key for the XCom. If provided, only XComs with matching
            keys will be returned. The default key is 'return_value', also
            available as a constant XCOM_RETURN_KEY. This key is automatically
            given to XComs returned by tasks (as opposed to being pushed
            manually). To remove the filter, pass key=None.
        :type key: str
        :param task_ids: Only XComs from tasks with matching ids will be
            pulled. Can pass None to remove the filter.
        :type task_ids: str or iterable of strings (representing task_ids)
        :param dag_id: If provided, only pulls XComs from this DAG.
            If None (default), the DAG of the calling task is used.
        :type dag_id: str
        :param include_prior_dates: If False, only XComs from the current
            execution_date are returned. If True, XComs from previous dates
            are returned as well.
        :type include_prior_dates: bool
