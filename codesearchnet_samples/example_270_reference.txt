            job will be launched.

        :param job: MLEngine Job object that should be provided to the MLEngine
            API, such as: ::

        :param use_existing_job_fn: In case that a MLEngine job with the same
            job_id already exist, this method (if provided) will decide whether
            we should use this existing job, continue waiting for it to finish
            and returning the job object. It should accepts a MLEngine job
            object, and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is OK to
            reuse the existing job. If 'use_existing_job_fn' is not provided,
            we by default reuse the existing MLEngine job.
        :type use_existing_job_fn: function

        :return: The MLEngine job object if the job successfully reach a
            terminal state (which might be FAILED or CANCELLED state).
