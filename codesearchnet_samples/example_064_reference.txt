Gets the max partition for a table.

    :param schema: The hive schema the table lives in
    :type schema: str
    :param table: The hive table you are interested in, supports the dot
        notation as in "my_database.my_table", if a dot is found,
        the schema param is disregarded
    :type table: str
    :param metastore_conn_id: The hive connection you are interested in.
        If your default is set you don't need to use this parameter.
    :type metastore_conn_id: str
    :param filter_map: partition_key:partition_value map used for partition filtering,
                       e.g. {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}.
                       Only partitions matching all partition_key:partition_value
                       pairs will be considered as candidates of max partition.
    :type filter_map: map
    :param field: the field to get the max value from. If there's only
        one partition field, this will be inferred
    :type field: str
