Return a version to identify the state of the underlying git repo. The version will
    indicate whether the head of the current git-backed working directory is tied to a
    release tag or not : it will indicate the former with a 'release:{version}' prefix
    and the latter with a 'dev0' prefix. Following the prefix will be a sha of the current
    branch head. Finally, a "dirty" suffix is appended to indicate that uncommitted
    changes are present.
