Sets the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with either:

        - The path to the keyfile from the specified connection id
        - A generated file's path if the user specified JSON in the connection id. The
            file is assumed to be deleted after the process dies due to how mkstemp()
            works.

        The environment variable is used inside the gcloud command to determine correct
        service account to use.
