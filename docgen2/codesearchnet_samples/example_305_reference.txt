Function decorator that Looks for an argument named "default_args", and
    fills the unspecified arguments from it.

    Since python2.* isn't clear about which arguments are missing when
    calling a function, and that this can be quite confusing with multi-level
    inheritance and argument defaults, this decorator also alerts with
    specific information about the missing arguments.
