Runs forever, monitoring the child processes of @gunicorn_master_proc and
    restarting workers occasionally.
    Each iteration of the loop traverses one edge of this state transition
    diagram, where each state (node) represents
    [ num_ready_workers_running / num_workers_running ]. We expect most time to
    be spent in [n / n]. `bs` is the setting webserver.worker_refresh_batch_size.
    The horizontal transition at ? happens after the new worker parses all the
    dags (so it could take a while!)

    We change the number of workers by sending TTIN and TTOU to the gunicorn
    master process, which increases and decreases the number of child workers
    respectively. Gunicorn guarantees that on TTOU workers are terminated
    gracefully and that the oldest worker is terminated.
