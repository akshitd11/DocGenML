        :param key: A key for the XCom
        :type key: str
        :param value: A value for the XCom. The value is pickled and stored
            in the database.
        :type value: any pickleable object
        :param execution_date: if provided, the XCom will not be visible until
            this date. This can be used, for example, to send a message to a
            task on a future date without it being immediately visible.
