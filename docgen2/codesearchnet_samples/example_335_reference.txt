Given a file path or a folder, this method looks for python modules,
        imports them and adds them to the dagbag collection.

        Note that if a ``.airflowignore`` file is found while processing
        the directory, it will behave much like a ``.gitignore``,
        ignoring files that match any of the regex patterns specified
        in the file.

        **Note**: The patterns in .airflowignore are treated as
        un-anchored regexes, not shell-like glob patterns.
