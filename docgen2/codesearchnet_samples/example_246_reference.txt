A role that allows you to include a list of template fields in the middle of the text. This is especially
    useful when writing guides describing how to use the operator.
    The result is a list of fields where each field is shorted in the literal block.

    Sample usage::

    :template-fields:`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_natural_language_operator.CloudLanguageAnalyzeSentimentOperator`
