Tries really hard to terminate all children (including grandchildren). Will send
    sig (SIGTERM) to the process group of pid. If any process is alive after timeout
    a SIGKILL will be send.

    :param log: log handler
    :param pid: pid to kill
    :param sig: signal type
    :param timeout: how much time a process has to terminate
